### NOTE ###
Since the main point of this exercise is too learn to read use
the dictionary data structure and I will not be using replit. 
I will be skipping this excercise. As an alterative I have rendered
a deck of cards in ascii format and stored them in a DICT. I aim to 
build a somewhat more advanced version of the day11 capstone to 
approximate this experiance.
