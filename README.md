# 100DaysOfPythonBootCamp
Implementations to follow the 100 Days of Python Boot Camp Udemy Course

#### The Course Can Be Found Here:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The main goal is to implement as many of the 100 days of code exercises (in Python) as possible without reference to the instructor's solutions. 

As an added challenge, I will be re-implementing as many exercises as I can in C as well. 

I welcome any and all contributions, references, comments, and improvements to this repo and any of the code in it.
